IMMIGRANT SONG

Ah, ah,
We come from the land of the ice and snow,
From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow
The hammer of the gods
Will drive our ships to new lands,
To fight the horde, singing and crying,
Valhalla, I am coming!
On we sweep with threshing oar,
Our only goal will be the western shore
Ah, ah,
We come from the land of the ice and snow,
From the midnight sun where the hot springs blow

How soft your fields so green,
Can whisper tales of gore,
Of how we calmed the tides of war
We are your overlords
On we sweep with threshing oar,
Our only goal will be the western shore
So now you'd better stop and rebuild all your ruins,
For peace and trust can win the day
Despite of all your losing
